## Commands

Lunar provides two system message commands, each with the same subcommands.

* `welcome`- Dispatched whenever a user joins the server.

* `goodbye` - Dispatched whenever a user leaves the server.

<Info>
  The following examples use the `welcome` command, but the same syntax is applied for the other system messages commands.
</Info>

<Note>
  The `goodbye` system hasn't been finished yet. Once it's finished it will still have the same syntax as the `welcome` command.
