## Setting the vanity to be monitored

You'll need to set what vanity you want to monitor. You can do this by using the `vanity set` command.

<Tip>
  It’s recommended to prefix the substring with a `/` (e.g. `/lunar`).
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Syntax
  ,vanity set (substring)
  ```

  ```javascript Example
  ,vanity set /lunar
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setting up roles to reward

You can use the `vanity role add` command to add a vanity reward.

<Info>
  If you no longer want to reward a role for a vanity, you can use the `vanity role remove` command.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Syntax
  ,vanity role add (role)
  ,vanity role remove (role)
  ```

  ```javascript Example
  ,vanity role add @Vanity
  ,vanity role remove @Vanity
  ```
</CodeGroup>
