## Setting the vanity to be monitored

You'll need to set what vanity you want to monitor. You can do this by using the `vanity set` command.

<Tip>
  It’s recommended to prefix the substring with a `/` (e.g. `/lunar`).
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Syntax
  ,vanity set (substring)
  ```

  ```javascript Example
  ,vanity set /lunar
  ```
</CodeGroup>
